# Visual Feedback Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented the foundation for visual feedback in the Scenic MCP server, giving AI the ability to "see" what's on screen in Scenic applications.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Modified Scenic Library
- Added a default `handle_call(:get_graph, ...)` handler to `Scenic.Scene`
- This allows all scenes to automatically expose their graph information
- Located in: `scenic_local/lib/scenic/scene.ex`

### 2. Enhanced MCP Server
- Updated `ScenicMcp.Server` to query scenes for their graphs
- Added `get_graphs_from_scenes/1` function that safely calls each scene
- Enhanced both summary and detailed graph descriptions

### 3. Created Test Infrastructure
- `test_get_graph.js` - Basic graph introspection test
- `test_enhanced_graph.js` - Tests enhanced graph capabilities

## Technical Details

### Default Handler Implementation
```elixir
def handle_call(:get_graph, _from, scene) do
  graph_info = %{
    module: __MODULE__,
    id: scene.id,
    assigns: scene.assigns,
    graph: Scenic.Graph.to_list(scene.assigns.graph)
  }
  {:reply, graph_info, scene}
end
```

### MCP Server Enhancement
The server now:
1. Finds all viewport processes
2. Queries each scene for its graph data
3. Aggregates and formats the information
4. Returns human-readable descriptions

## How to Test

1. Start Flamelex with the MCP server:
```bash
cd flamelex
iex -S mix
```

2. Run the enhanced graph test:
```bash
cd scenic_mcp
./test_enhanced_graph.js
```

## Next Steps

1. **Parse Graph Primitives**: Convert raw graph data into more descriptive text
2. **Element Identification**: Add IDs or tags to UI elements for targeting
3. **Smart Interactions**: Click elements by description rather than coordinates
4. **Visual State Tracking**: Detect UI changes and wait for elements

## Key Insights

- Scenic's architecture stores graphs in individual scene processes
- The ViewPort maintains the scene hierarchy but doesn't store graphs
- Each scene can customize its graph exposure by overriding the handler
- This approach allows for flexible introspection without modifying core Scenic

## Integration with Flamelex

The modified Scenic library is already integrated with Flamelex through the local dependency. Any Scenic application using this approach will automatically have graph introspection capabilities.
